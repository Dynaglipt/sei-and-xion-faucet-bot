## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (Node package manager)
- **Capsolver API key** (required for the XION bot)
- **2Captcha API key** (required for the Sei bot)
- A list of wallet addresses to claim tokens.
- Optional: A list of proxies for improved anonymity.

## Installation

To set up the faucet bots, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sinak1023/sei-and-xion-faucet-bot
   cd sei-and-xion-faucet-bot
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file for the XION bot and add your API key:

   ```plaintext
   CAPSOLVER_API_KEY=your_capsolver_api_key_here
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file for the Sei bot and add your API key:

   ```plaintext
   TWOCAPTCHA_API_KEY=your_2captcha_api_key_here
   ```

## Configuration

### Setting Up Your Wallet Addresses

To configure your wallet addresses, create a file named `wallets.txt` in the root directory. Add each wallet address on a new line. The bot will read from this file to automate the claiming process.

### Configuring Proxies (Optional)

If you want to use proxies, create a file named `proxies.txt` in the root directory. List each proxy on a new line. The bot will rotate through these proxies during operation.

### Adjusting Delays and Retries

You can customize the delay between requests and the number of retries on failure. Modify the relevant variables in the bot scripts as needed.

## Usage

To run the bots, use the following commands:

### XION Faucet Bot

```bash
node xion-faucet-bot.js
```

### Sei Network Faucet Bot

```bash
node sei-faucet-bot.js
```

Both bots will start claiming tokens from their respective faucets based on your configuration. Monitor the console for detailed logs and output.
